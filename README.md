GitHub Repo Search Application
====================

## Functional requirements
* Provide a form that allows you to search for repositories on Github (using https://developer.github.com/v3/search/ )
    * by name, optionally filtered by language and minimum number of stars
    * by text contained in the title of an (open/closed) issue (e.g. you search for "octopress" and you get all the repositories that have issues containing that term)
* Visualize the information returned by github by showing at least
    * the name of the repo
    * the avatar of the owner
    * the creation date
    * the (primary) language
    * the number of stars and watchers
    * the number of open issues
